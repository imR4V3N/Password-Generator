 This project is a simple web application for generating and copying passwords. Here is a detailed description of its components, based on the snippet provided:

* HTML structure (index.html): The index.html file serves as the skeleton of the application.
* JavaScript Script: A link to the JavaScript file (script.js) that likely contains the logic to generate the password and copy functionality.

**Expected features:**

* Password Generation: The user can generate a new password by clicking on the “Generate” button. The generated password is then displayed in the text field.
* Password copy: The user can copy the displayed password to the clipboard by clicking on the “Copy code” button.

**External resources:**

* Icon and Style: The application uses external resources for the icon (./assets/image/icon.png) and CSS file (./assets/css/style.css) to customize its appearance.
* JavaScript: Interactive behavior is managed by an external JavaScript file (./assets/js/script.js).

In summary, this project is an interactive web application for generating and copying passwords, designed to be simple and easy to use, with a minimalist user interface.
